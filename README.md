# Image-Editor-Software
Desktop image editor application built with Python that supports image loading, brightness adjustment, and grayscale conversion.
The Python Image Editor is a simple desktop application developed using Python, Tkinter, and Pillow (PIL) libraries. It allows users to open, view, and edit images in an easy-to-use graphical interface. The main features of this project include opening image files, converting images to grayscale, and adjusting brightness using a slider.

This project helps in understanding how graphical user interfaces (GUI) work in Python and how images can be processed using libraries like Pillow. It demonstrates important programming concepts such as event handling, image manipulation, and GUI design. The application can be extended further by adding more features like image rotation, cropping, saving edited images, and applying filters.
